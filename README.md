# My Personal Research on Control & Artificial Intelligence Team , BRACU MONGOL-TORI (OCTOBER 2020 - MARCH 2022)

This repository contains only the codes and documents that I have researched while working on Mongol-Tori Team as a Senior member and later as the Sub-Team Lead.

### GUI
1. PyQt GUI with basic operations, camera feeds, and GPS with map readout
2. Record data from camera, GPS, and science system
3. Robot feedback

### GPS
1. Map GPS waypoints
2. "Implement differential GNSS for higher accuracy"?
3. Find direct route between waypoints

### GPS Rover
1. Latitude & Longitude based navigation (Motor Driver Code Included) 

### Mongol Test Socket
1. Socket System for Mars Rover Control 

### Mongol Tori Control Hardwares 
1. Basic Hardwares & Pin Diagram of the Mongol-Tori Mars Rover 

### Motor Driver Codes
1. Implementation of various motor driver (Testing Code Included) 

### Sensor Graph GUI
1. Developed GUI for Science Sensor Box

### PySerial Codebase
1. Control System Based on PySerial (Multiple Motor Drivers Implemented) 

### Rover ROS
1. Control System Based on ROS (Neotic) 

### ARM & Navigation Combined 
1. Combined system of ARM Control & Rover Wheel Control using ROS


### Autonomous Navigation
1. Simple "wall detection" using depth camera
2. SLAM
3. SLAM with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
4. Online route modification given obstacle avoidance algorithm, detected marker location, and gps waypoint locations

### ArUco Marker Detection
1. Detect marker in controlled environment
2. Use object detection to find approximate location of marker (may not be necessary)
3. Calculate distance to marker

### ROS
1. Control structure with all data streams
